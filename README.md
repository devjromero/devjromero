# 👋 Hi there! I'm Andres!

🚀 Full Stack Engineer | Cloud Developer | Dev Life Enthusiast

With 7+ years of experience turning coffee ☕ into scalable, production-ready web and mobile applications. I craft solutions using:

**🧠 Frontend & Mobile**  
- ReactJS ⚛️ | React Native 📱 | TypeScript ✨

**🔧 Backend**  
- Node.js 🔙 | Express | SQL & NoSQL (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)

**☁️ Cloud & DevOps**  
- AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, S3, Cognito...)  
- AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)  
- Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)  
- Heroku (when you want it quick and simple)  
- CI/CD and deployment pipelines

**🤖 AI & Automation**  
- Claude.ai 🤖 (yes, I'm playing with frontier AI too!)  
- Automation & workflow improvements  
- 3rd-party integrations (Stripe, Auth0, etc.)

## 👨‍💻 What I'm about:
I love building **efficient**, **secure**, and **user-focused** solutions that help businesses grow. Whether it's architecting cloud infrastructure, optimizing frontend performance, or improving developer workflows—I'm your guy.

I’m also big on:
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Aligning with cross-functional teams
- Documenting processes so no one cries later 😅

---

## 🔍 Currently exploring:
- 🧠 More AI integrations (Claude, GPT, open-source models)  
- 🏗️ Infrastructure best practices with Terraform  
- 📦 Developer experience (DX) tools
